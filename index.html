                <p>Thorfinn Karlsefni, the central character in the "Saga of the Vinland," was a Viking from Iceland who lived in the 11th century. 
                    The son of the prominent Viking Karl Thorfinn, he grew up during the Age of the Vikings. After his father was killed, Thorfinn sailed to Greenland seeking vengeance. 
                    His plans changed when he joined expeditions to the New World, known as Vinland in Norse sagas. 
                    Thorfinn became a key figure in exploring and attempting to settle these lands. He eventually returned to Iceland, where he retired to a monastery, spending his later years in spiritual reflection.</p>
